<!--

HTML DOM : DOM stands for Document Object Model.

Document: This refers to your web page. When your browser loads a web page, 
it creates a Document Object Model of that page.

Object: Each part of your web page (like paragraphs, images, etc.) is represented as an object in the DOM. 
So you can think of the DOM as a collection of objects that you can manipulate.

Model: It's like a blueprint or structure of your web page. 
It tells you how all the elements are organized and how you can access them.

When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects.


example:
--> 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    
    <title>DOM learning</title>
    <style>
        .bg-black{
            background-color: #212121;
            color: #fff;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body class="bg-black">
    <div >
        <h1  id="title" class="heading">DOM learning <span style="display: none;">test text</span></h1>
        <h2>Lorem ipsum dolor sit.</h2>
        <h2>Lorem ipsum dolor sit.</h2>
        <h2>Lorem ipsum dolor sit.</h2>
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
        <input type="password" name="" id="">

        <ul>
            <li class="list-item">one</li>
            <li class="list-item">two</li>
            <li class="list-item">three</li>
            <li class="list-item">four</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
